        "designSummary": "**The Sacred Glitch: A Fusion of Ancient Mysticism and Afrofuturist Boldness**\n\nThe Vision: We are building a digital temple—a space where the ancient language of Nidalum meets the boundless possibilities of the future. The design is a deliberate collision of sacred geometry and digital distortion, creating a visual experience that is both awe-inspiring and unsettling. Think less 'corporate website' and more 'portal to another dimension'.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Broken Monolith Grid: A 6-column grid forms the foundation, but elements will intentionally break free, overlapping and extending beyond its boundaries to evoke a sense of ancient structures crumbling into the digital age.\n2. Typography as Sacred Geometry: Headlines are not just text; they are visual incantations. The vertical Toraé-Shira alphabet will be integrated as a recurring graphic motif, adding a layer of cryptic symbolism.\n3. The Glitch in the System: Introduce subtle 'glitch' effects—a momentary flicker, a distorted line—to remind users that they are traversing a digital space, not a physical one. This can be achieved with CSS animations and transitions.\n4. Light as Revelation: Use light and shadow to guide the eye and create a sense of depth. The ancient gold and astral blue should feel like they are emanating from within the screen, not just applied to its surface.",

A muted gray-beige serves as a neutral background to soften and balance the intense color palette. Typography is geometric and sans-serif, with large uppercase headings that convey strength and modernity, complemented by clean, readable body text. The layout is modular and grid-based, balancing text and imagery with generous spacing and asymmetrical compositions to maintain visual interest.

The design is a deliberate collision of sacred geometry and digital distortion, creating a visual experience that is both awe-inspiring and unsettling. Think less 'corporate website' and more 'portal to another dimension'.\n\n**Execution Blueprint:**\n1. The Broken Monolith Grid: A 6-column grid forms the foundation, but elements will intentionally break free, overlapping and extending beyond its boundaries to evoke a sense of ancient structures crumbling into the digital age.\n2. Typography as Sacred Geometry: Headlines are not just text; they are visual incantations. The vertical Toraé-Shira alphabet will be integrated as a recurring graphic motif, adding a layer of cryptic symbolism.\n3. The Glitch in the System: Introduce subtle 'glitch' effects—a momentary flicker, a distorted line—to remind users that they are traversing a digital space, not a physical one. This can be achieved with CSS animations and transitions.\n4. Light as Revelation: Use light and shadow to guide the eye and create a sense of depth. The ancient gold and astral blue should feel like they are emanating from within the screen, not just applied to its surface.",
